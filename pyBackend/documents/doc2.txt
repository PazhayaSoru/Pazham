How to Make Personal Budget in 6 Easy Steps?
A personal finance budget is a financial tool that helps you control your expenses and save for the future. But to make a personal budget can be daunting, as it involves multiple processes and decisions to be taken. So, how can you make a personal budget for yourself?

By following the below steps, you can build a perfect personal budget and make informed decisions about your money.

1) Find the objective
It is impossible to predict the future, but a few basic questions need to be answered early on in life. For example, when do you want to retire? What are your plans after retirement? Do you want to buy a house? Whether you want/have children, and if yes, then what are your plans for them? List your priorities and write them down. The process of writing them down will help you simplify things, and this is known as financial planning.
Most people fail to manage their personal finance only because they do not have a clear agenda set for themselves. This practice will help you understand how much you need to save for each purpose and for how long. More importantly, priorities change from time to time, hence, change your personal financial plans accordingly.

2) Identify your expenses
Track your family expenses for two to three months to find out how much is spent on what task every month. Identify the absolute essentiantial and allot money accordingly. First make sure to pay for the fixed expenditures like home loan/ rent, car loan, utility bills etc. and then prepare a budget for the variable expenses like grocery shopping, eating out, movie nights and others. Make sure that you do not spend more than you have allotted in each of the buckets. Also, if you feel that you are spending more than you can afford, then make sure to check on the expenses especially the variable factors.

3) Separate need from want
Separating your needs from your wants is very crucial for financial freedom. There are many things that we want, but it has to match with what we can afford. It might seem easy that loans and credit cards have increased our power to buy more, but there is always a catch. For example, your car is a depreciating asset, and hence, it is always suggested that you buy in the range for which you can pay back the loan within five years. Now, with easy bank loans, it may seem that you can buy a car worth Rs 20 lakh, whereas you can afford one that costs Rs 7 lakh, i.e. you can comfortably repay this amount within five years. Probably, for your second car, you might plan to buy the Rs 20 lakh model, considering your salary and net worth will increase in the next five years.

Refrain from using credit cards as much as possible. It can completely destroy the health of your personal finances.

4) Plan ahead
There are yearly expenses from tax/insurance payment to holidays that can be planned ahead. If you keep aside a small amount every month targeted towards a particular expense, then at the end of the year you will be financially prepared for it. Often people end up taking personal loans for such purposes and keep on paying for it, including the interest rate, for the rest of the year. Simply, if we can reverse the cycle and plan ahead, then we can save ourselves from some unnecessary stress and losing money.

One of the strategies that you can use while making plans for the future is the 50-30-20 rule. This rule helps you create a personal budget by breaking your finances into three parts.

50% for Needs: You can allocate 50% of your income to cover mandatory expenses, such as house rent, phone bills, electricity, groceries, etc.
30% for Desires: You can allocate 30% of your income to cover leisure activities such as vacation, shopping, entertainment, etc.
20% for Investments: You should allocate 20% of your income for savings and investments. Here, you can invest in mutual funds, fixed deposits, PPF, NPS, etc., depending on your goals.
5) Emergency corpus
Even before you start saving and investing, it is necessary to build an emergency corpus. This is a fund that is set aside for emergencies and the rule is you should never touch it unless there is an emergency.
Now, how do you define an emergency? Paying your credit card bill is definitely not one of them. This money can provide financial relief during job loss, illness and accidents. The size of the fund should be three to six months of monthly expenses that is necessary to survive. Building an emergency corpus is a crucial aspect of your personal financial planning and money management.

6) Make sure to save
There is a simple formula to know how much you can afford to spend.

Income – Saving = Expenses

Fashion your expenses around this formula. Now, how do you know how much to save?
First, set aside 10 percent of your income as your retirement corpus and never use it for any other purpose, not even for your children’s education or marriage. Next set your future goals, short-term, mid-term and long-term, plans basis your priorities. Apart from retirement plan, long-term goals include children’s education plan and marriage plan etc, mid-term goals include down payment for a house or car, and short-term plans include travel, buying gadget and appliances etc.. Set aside some money as per your estimate in each of the buckets, and whatever is left, you should plan your personal budget around it.

Believe it or not, a little financial discipline can make a big difference to the health of your personal finance. Start small but start early to see your money grow exponentially – this is the best practice among all the money management rules.
